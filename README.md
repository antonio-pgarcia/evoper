# EvoPER

Evolutionary Parameter Estimation for 'Repast Simphony' Models.

[![Rdoc](http://www.rdocumentation.org/badges/version/rrepast)](http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/rrepast)

## Description

The EvoPER, Evolutionary Parameter Estimation for 'Repast Simphony'
    Agent-Based framework (<https://repast.github.io/>), provides optimization
    driven parameter estimation methods based on evolutionary computation
    techniques which could be more efficient and require, in some cases,
    fewer model evaluations than other alternatives relying on experimental design.
