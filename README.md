# EvoPER

Evolutionary Parameter Estimation for 'Repast Simphony' Models.

## Description

The EvoPER, Evolutionary Parameter Estimation for 'Repast Simphony'
    Agent-Based framework, provides optimization driven parameter estimation methods
    based on evolutionary computation techniques which could be more efficient and
    require, in some cases, fewer model evaluations than other alternatives
    relaying on experimental design.
